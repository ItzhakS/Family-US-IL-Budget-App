# Family US-IL Budget App

This project was initially started in Google AI Studio.
As the app grew in complexity, development moved out of AI Studio because the AI workflow could not reliably handle the larger scope.

The app is now managed in Cursor and deployed on Vercel.

Original AI Studio project: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/13v0V7Ek6fnDBb_DfKsNv14MowVTrVyeK
